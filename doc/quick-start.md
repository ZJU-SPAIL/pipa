# Quick Start

This document takes you through the basics of using pipa by measuring the performance of the perf bench as an example.

## Installation

Use the following command to install the package:

```shell
pip install pypipa
```

## Data Collection

First of all, use command `pipa generate`

```sh
❯ pipa generate
? Please select the way of workload you want to run. Build a script that collects performance data and start the workloa
d by perf.
? Where do you want to store your data? (Default: ./)
 ./data
? What's the frequency of perf-record? (Default: 999)
 999
? What's the event of perf-record? (Default: {cycles,instructions}:S)
 {cycles,instructions}:S
? Whether to use perf-annotate?
 No
? Do you want to use perf-stat or emon?
 perf-stat
? What's count deltas of perf-stat? (Default: 1000 milliseconds)
 1000
? What's the event of perf-stat?
 cycles,instructions,branch-misses,L1-dcache-load-misses,L1-icache-load-misses
? Whether to use taskset?
 Yes
? Which cores do you want to use? (Default: 0-47)
 0-47
? What's the command of workload?
 perf bench futex hash
Shell script generated successfully.
Please check the script in ./data/pipa-run.sh
Note that you may need to modify the script to meet your requirements. The core list is generated according to the
machine which runs this script now. pipa-run.sh is more suitable for reproducible workloads such as benchmark.
```

In this example, we use the `perf bench futex hash` as the observed workload, which is a micro benchmark that comes with perf. As long as perf is installed successfully, you don't need to install any dependencies to run this example.

If all goes well, you will get the following script, in the `data/pipa-run.sh`.

```sh
#!/bin/bash
# The script generated by PIPA-TREE is used to collect performance data.
# Please check whether it meets expectations before running.

echo 'Performance data collected successfully.'
```


This script will run the workload twice, using `perf record` and` perf stat` + `sar` to make observations and save the corresponding data. In addition, before running, the process data will be checked to determine the noise level, and after running, the system configuration file will be exported.

After the running script is built, you can run it and redirect the results to a file.

```shell
bash ./data/pipa-run.sh > ./data/pipa-run.log
```

## Data Loading & Visualization

Before running the following data loading and visualization steps, we recommend that you configure your Python and Jupyter notebook environments.

```py
from pipa.service.pipashu import PIPAShuData

pipashu = PIPAShuData(
    perf_stat_path="./data/perf-stat.csv",
    sar_path="./data/sar.txt",
    perf_record_path="./data/perf.script",
)
```

We can find the following output information in pipa-run.log.

```bash

Averaged 2676646 operations/sec (+- 0.09%), total secs = 10
```

After summing the above throughput and multiplying the time (10 seconds), we can calculate the total number of transactions, which is 1284790070.


After that, we can use pipa's data based on perf-stat and sar to calculate some general metrics, covering CPU, memory, and disk.

```py
pipashu.get_metrics(num_transcations = 1284790070, threads = list(range(48)))
```

It is worth noting that by default, if no disk is specified, the disk with the highest utilization will be selected. The best practice is for users to identify which disk they are using before running the experiment and pass it here as a parameter.

```py
def get_metrics(
    num_transcations: int,
    threads: list,
    run_time: int = None,
    dev: str | None = None,
    freq_MHz: int = None
):
    pass
```

## Dump
Before formally uploading PIPASHU data, you can use PIPA dump to dump overview data to a file.

```shell
pipa dump -o <output_file> -c <config_file> -v
```
`-c <config_file>`: PIPA provides a template config file [config-upload.yaml](https://github.com/ZJU_SPAIL/pipa/blob/main/asset/config-upload.yaml).If this parameter is missed, you can dump data in a cmd interaction manner. 

`-v`: If this parameter is used, output file will be printed to the screen.

## Upload
PIPA provides two ways to upload your performance data with detailed information. One is to upload in command line interation, and the other is to upload with YAML.

### Upload in cmd interaction manner
Use the following command line to upload data in a cmd interaction manner:
```shell
pipa upload
```
Then 
```bash
? What's the name of workload? Kafka
? What's the number of transaction? 10000000
? Where's the data collected by PIPAShu? data
? What are the threads used in the workload? Split by , 0,1,2,3
? What's the used disk device name? dm-2
? What's the hardware configuration (sockets*cores*SMT)? 1*1*1
? What's the software configuration? JDK1.8
? What's the platform? IceLake 8383C
? Any comments?
? What's the PIPAD server address?
? What's the PIPAD server port?
```

### Upload with YAML
Use the following command line to upload data with YAML:
```shell
pipa upload <config_file>
```
PIPA provides a template configuration file [config-upload.yaml](https://github.com/ZJU_SPAIL/pipa/blob/main/asset/config-upload.yaml).
```yaml
# PIPA-Shu Upload Configuration
# Use pipa upload to upload the data to PIPAD server based on this configuration.
# Command Example: pipa upload --config_path=./data/config-upload.yaml
workload: rocksdb
# The name of the workload.
transaction: 7561946
# The number of transactions.
data_location: /path/to/data/collected/by/pipashu
# The location of the data collected by PIPAShu.

cores: [36, 37, 38, 39]
# The numbers of logical cores used in the workload.
dev: sdc
# The used disk device name.

hw_info: 1*4*1
# The hardware configuration (sockets*cores*SMT).
sw_info: RocksDB 7.9.2 build in release mode, debug_level=0, threads_num=16, db_bench with benchmark.sh
# The software configuration.

platform: Intel SPR 4510
# The platform user used.
cpu_frequency_mhz: 2600
# The CPU frequency in MHz.
# Only needed when the platform is Huawei.

comment: "This is a template for the upload configuration."
# Any comments.
pipad_addr: 10.82.77.113
# The PIPAD server address.
pipad_port: 50051
# The PIPAD server port.

```

Data location is the directory of your PIPASHU data. It should at least include:
```bash
data/
├── perf-stat.csv
├── perf.script
└── sar.txt
```

Cores list is the cores you want to focus on. To get the list quickly, you can use python list.
```shell
$ python
